        "- The main difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how the code is translated into machine-readable instructions. Compiled languages use a compiler to convert the entire source code into machine code before execution, producing a standalone executable file that the computer can run directly. This typically results in faster performance and allows programs to run without needing the original source code, but it also requires a longer development cycle since the code must be recompiled after changes. Examples include C, C++, Rust, and Go. In contrast, interpreted languages are executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime, without creating a separate executable file. This approach allows for quicker testing and development, and the code is generally more portable across platforms as long as an interpreter is available. However, interpreted code tends to run more slowly and always requires the interpreter to execute. Examples of interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP. Some languages, like Java and C#, combine both approaches by compiling source code into intermediate bytecode, which is then interpreted or JIT-compiled by a virtual machine."
